# Adaptive Propagation Graph Convolutional Network (AP-GCN)

This is the companion code for the paper:
[Adaptive Propagation Graph Convolutional Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01907), *arXiv:1905.01907*, 2020.

### The Spectral K

We introduce the adaptive propagation graph convolutional network (AP-GCN), a variation of GCN wherein each node selects automatically the number of propagation steps performed across the graph.

### Organization of the code

All the code for the models described in the paper can be found in *model.py*. An example of use which can be quickly extendet to the full experimental evaluation is provided in *AP-GCN_demo.ipynb*.
